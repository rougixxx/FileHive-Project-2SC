# FileHive-Project-2SC
## A 4th year multidisciplinary project 
As part of our 4th-year final project, our team developed FileHive, a platform focused on secure file sharing with advanced cybersecurity features. The project included:
- File & Document Sharing Website: A secure platform for sharing files.
- Attack Simulations: Implemented simulations of attacks like Remote Code Execution, XSS, SQL Injection, and File Type Validation Bypass using tools such as Metasploit, Burp Suite, and SQLMap.
- Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDS/IPS): Developed machine learning and deep learning models to detect and block malware and SQL injection attempts, alongside a banning system and logging features.
- Tech Stack: Next.js (frontend), Django (backend), PostgreSQL, Redux Toolkit, ClickUp (project management), and design tools like Figma and Photoshop.
